Hi, python-rtmidi's author here. I agree, the situation is unfortunate, and came about, as it is often with these things, as the result of events long in the past. When I started python-rtmidi in 2012, there was only patrickkidd's version and it wasn't properly maintained then, there wasn't even a proper release on PyPI. rtmidi-python (another conflicting package) was started later that year and its author obviously didn't see or care about my already released version on PyPI. Back then, it wasn't like today, where almost every project is in GitHub and easy to discover.
